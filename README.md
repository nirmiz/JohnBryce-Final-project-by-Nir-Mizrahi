*Linux operating system- This python code can only be run with a Linux operating system and installing a Virtual-Machine with a Linux operating
system is the perfect solution for you WINDOWS 10 users out there:
1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB_5fqiysi4
2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MhydijWmc
3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM

This 3 YouTube videos should guide you to install a Linux operating system Virtual-Machine on WINDOWS 10 if you don't already have one...

-

*Python- Once you have installed and successfully logged into your Virtual-Machine, 
Open the terminal using  Ctrl+Alt+T  
or by clicking on the terminal icon in the top left of your screen which should look something like this:

![terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87423500/125613556-51b969d9-3d3b-4358-8d94-31c9f1ceb11f.png)

Once Terminal is Open, Type the command "Sudo apt install python" after typing your password and confirming the download by typing Y, The download will start which shouldn't take too long.

-

*Root privilages- You wouldn't be able to download python or capture network traffic without root privilages, "Sudo" is a command opener to grant access to root privilages.
All you need to do is to remember the password you used to log-in with:)

-


AND FINALY once you are done and ready you should now be able to Run the code and capture your Network traffic successfully!
