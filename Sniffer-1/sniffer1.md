To run this Sniffer open the terminal and type the command:

Sudo python sniffer1.py

Disclaimer:
This is the most basic packet sniffer in python using socket.
The output will be a mess but this is only because this code shows just a dump of the network packets in hex.

So alittle bit about the code:
First we import the modules 


















In the next code (sniffer.py) we will unpack the packets and it will look visualy better and more readable:)
